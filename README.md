### About the Project
The code provided in the repository demonstrates how to:
 Load and preprocess the dataset.
 Fine-tune a DistilBERT model for sentiment classification.
 Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report.

 ### Requirements
 Python 3.x
 Libraries: transformers, torch, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

 ### Instructions
 Download the tweets dataset by using the provided link.
 Open the new notebook in colab.
 Upload the downloaded dataset to the session storage.

 ### Training the model
 run 'AI_Phase5.ipynb'
 After Training is complete the program will evaluate its performance, and display the accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
